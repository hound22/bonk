## Bonk Resource Pack
This resource pack replaces the sounds for player giving/taking damages and melee attacks to the sound of bonk from the infamous [bonk meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bonk-cheems).

On the 18th of August, 2023, the shiba inu who was the face of that bonk meme, Balltze, left us and I've made this pack to memorialize him. I have a strong attachment to Ball Ball and this meme, it has brought me and my friends years of joy. He will live on, through us. 
You can read about his passing away [here](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/beloved-meme-dog-cheems-passes-away-at-12-years-of-age).
