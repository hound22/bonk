## Bonk Resource Pack
This resource pack replaces the sounds for player giving/taking damages and melee attacks to the sound of bonk from the infamous [bonk meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bonk-cheems).

On the 18th of August, 2023, the shiba inu who was the face of that bonk meme, Balltze, left us and I've made this pack to memorialize him. I have a strong attachment to Ball Ball and this meme, it has brought me and my friends years of joy. He will live on, through us. <br>
You can read about his passing away [here](https://knowyourmeme.com/news/beloved-meme-dog-cheems-passes-away-at-12-years-of-age).
